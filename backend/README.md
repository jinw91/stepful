# Swagger and APIs

I've added swagger to more easily add to the database. Obviously you can look for the credentials and directly modify it (located on AWS).
To access swagger, enter: http://localhost:4000/api-docs/ in your browser of choice and you should see options for each controller. Let me know if that's not the case.
